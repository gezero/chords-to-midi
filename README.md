# Chords to Midi
Simple program to help me create a midi file with chords progressions

# Description
I just started learning playing the piano. I learn using [Synthesia game](https://www.synthesiagame.com/). 
I feel like I am progressing. My friend told me that I should try to learn how to play chords.
There is a very nice [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjN3-ZeuJaY) that I liked.
It is however difficult for me to learn this style of playing without guidance from Synthesia. 
That is why I am working on this project.

# Usage
For now I just need the program to create a chords progression from list of chords that I will provide. 
So when the main starts there is an dialog where I paste the chords progression and the output is a midi file.

#Links
Synthesia has a file format that contains metadata about a midi file. Here is [link to the guide](http://www.synthesiagame.com/support/guide/contentCreators).
